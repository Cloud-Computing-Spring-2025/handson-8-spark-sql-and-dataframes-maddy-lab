## **Assignment Tasks**

You are required to complete the following three analysis tasks using Spark Structured APIs. Ensure that your analysis is well-documented, with clear explanations and any relevant visualizations or summaries.

### **1. Hashtag Trends **

**Objective:**

Identify trending hashtags by analyzing their frequency of use across all posts.

**Tasks:**

- **Extract Hashtags**: Split the `Hashtags` column and flatten it into individual hashtag entries.
- **Count Frequency**: Count how often each hashtag appears.
- **Find Top Hashtags**: Identify the top 10 most frequently used hashtags.


**Expected Outcome:**  
A ranked list of the most-used hashtags and their frequencies.

**Example Output:**

| Hashtag     | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| #tech       | 120   |
| #mood       | 98    |
| #design     | 85    |

### **2. Engagement by Age Group**

**Objective:**  
Understand how users from different age groups engage with content based on likes and retweets.

**Tasks:**

- **Join Datasets**: Combine `posts.csv` and `users.csv` using `UserID`.
- **Group by AgeGroup**: Calculate average likes and retweets for each age group.
- **Rank Groups**: Sort the results to highlight the most engaged age group.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A summary of user engagement behavior categorized by age group.

**Example Output:**

| Age Group | Avg Likes | Avg Retweets |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Adult     | 67.3      | 25.2         |
| Teen      | 22.0      | 5.6          |
| Senior    | 9.2       | 1.3          |

---

### **3. Sentiment vs Engagement**

**Objective:**  
Evaluate how sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) influences post engagement.

**Tasks:**

- **Categorize Posts**: Group posts into Positive (`>0.3`), Neutral (`-0.3 to 0.3`), and Negative (`< -0.3`) sentiment groups.
- **Analyze Engagement**: Calculate average likes and retweets per sentiment category.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Insights into whether happier or angrier posts get more attention.

**Example Output:**

| Sentiment | Avg Likes | Avg Retweets |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Positive  | 85.6      | 32.3         |
| Neutral   | 27.1      | 10.4         |
| Negative  | 13.6      | 4.7          |

### **4. Top Verified Users by Reach**

**Objective:**  
Find the most influential verified users based on their post reach (likes + retweets).

**Tasks:**

- **Filter Verified Users**: Use `Verified = True` from `users.csv`.
- **Calculate Reach**: Sum likes and retweets for each user.
- **Rank Users**: Return top 5 verified users with highest total reach.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A leaderboard of verified users based on audience engagement.

**Example Output:**

| Username       | Total Reach |
|----------------|-------------|
| @techie42      | 1650        |
| @designer_dan  | 1320        |

## **Grading Criteria**

| Task                        | Marks |
|-----------------------------|-------|
| Hashtag Trend Analysis      | 1     |
| Engagement by Age Group     | 1     |
| Sentiment vs Engagement     | 1     |
| Top Verified Users by Reach | 1     |
| **Total**                   | **1** |

## ✅ Approach & Implementation

### Environment Setup

- We used **Bitnami’s Spark Docker image** and orchestrated a multi-container Spark setup using `docker-compose`.
- The project source code, input files (`posts.csv`, `users.csv`), and output directory were mounted into the container under `/app`.

### Execution Steps

1. We mounted local folders (`./input`, `./src`, `./outputs`) to `/app` in the container to ensure accessibility inside `spark-master`.
2. Entered the container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it my-spark-master bash
   cd /app
   ```
3. Executed each Spark job with:
   ```bash
   spark-submit src/task1_hashtag_trends.py
   spark-submit src/task2_engagement_by_age.py
   spark-submit src/task3_sentiment_vs_engagement.py
   spark-submit src/task4_top_verified_users.py
   ```

## ✅ Summary of Results

### 1. Hashtag Trends
- We extracted and exploded comma-separated hashtags.
- Computed frequencies and displayed top 10.
- Output saved in: `outputs/hashtag_trends.csv`

### 2. Engagement by Age Group
- Joined `posts.csv` with `users.csv` on `UserID`.
- Grouped by `AgeGroup` and calculated average likes and retweets.
- Output saved in: `outputs/engagement_by_age.csv`

### 3. Sentiment vs Engagement
- Categorized posts into Positive, Neutral, Negative based on `SentimentScore`.
- Computed average engagement metrics per category.
- Output saved in: `outputs/sentiment_engagement.csv`

### 4. Top Verified Users by Reach
- Filtered users where `Verified = True`.
- Calculated total reach as `Likes + Retweets` and ranked top 5.
- Output saved in: `outputs/top_verified_users.csv`
